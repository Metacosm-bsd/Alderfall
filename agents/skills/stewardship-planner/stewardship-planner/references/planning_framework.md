## Part 1: Goal-Setting Framework

### Seven Core Forest Stewardship Goals

Each goal has distinct values, methods, and typical trade-offs with other goals. No forest can maximize all goals simultaneously—stewardship is about intentional prioritization.

#### 1. Wildlife Habitat & Biodiversity

**Definition:** Create conditions that support diverse wildlife species, maintain ecological connectivity, and support natural processes.

**Methods:**
- Maintain structural diversity (multiple canopy layers, deadwood, snags)
- Preserve and expand wildlife corridors to adjacent protected lands
- Create edge habitat where different forest types meet
- Manage for specific species (deer, songbirds, pollinators, etc.)
- Maintain den trees, cavity trees, mast-producing species

**Indicators of success:**
- Species richness (number of different species observed)
- Wildlife sign (tracks, scat, vocalizations)
- Nesting/denning success rates
- Genetic diversity in populations
- Corridor connectivity and use patterns

**Timeline:** Visible changes in 3-5 years; full ecosystem recovery 20-30 years

**Conflicts with:**
- **Timber revenue** — Old-growth timber is prime habitat; harvesting disrupts it
- **Recreation** — Heavy trail use can degrade habitat; species are sensitive to human presence
- **Aesthetic value** — Deadwood and snags are ugly; dense understory limits views

**Cost profile:** Varies widely
- Passive (minimal intervention): $500-1,000/year
- Active (invasive removal, planting native species): $3,000-8,000/year
- Intensive (habitat engineering, wildlife crossings): $10,000+/year

---

#### 2. Timber Revenue & Sustainable Harvesting

**Definition:** Generate income through sustainable timber harvesting while maintaining long-term forest productivity.

**Methods:**
- Selective thinning (remove weaker/diseased trees, reduce competition)
- Shelterwood harvest (remove overstory in stages to allow regeneration)
- Clearcut and replant (highest yield, but highest disruption)
- Market timber during favorable price windows
- Manage for specific timber species with high market value

**Indicators of success:**
- Annual or periodic revenue generated
- Timber volume available at harvest
- Market prices during harvest window
- Tree growth rates between harvests
- Regeneration success after harvest

**Timeline:** Revenue in 10-50 years depending on method
- Thinning: 10-15 year cycles, modest revenue
- Shelterwood: 20-30 years, moderate revenue
- Clearcut/replant: 40-60 years, highest total revenue

**Conflicts with:**
- **Wildlife habitat** — Harvesting removes structure; frequent harvest prevents old-growth development
- **Carbon sequestration** — Harvesting removes stored carbon
- **Aesthetic value** — Clear evidence of logging activity
- **Recreation** — Access disrupted during harvest; visual impact

**Cost profile:**
- Planning/inventory: $1,500-3,000
- Thinning labor: $600-1,000/acre
- Harvesting: Professional operator (may be revenue-neutral or positive)
- Road maintenance: $300-800/year

**Revenue profile (highly variable with market):**
- Thinning: $300-1,500/acre
- Shelterwood: $1,000-3,000/acre
- Clearcut: $2,000-5,000/acre (mature timber)

---

#### 3. Carbon Sequestration & Climate Benefit

**Definition:** Maximize carbon storage in forest biomass and soils to contribute to climate change mitigation.

**Methods:**
- Maintain mature, older trees (store most carbon)
- Minimize harvest (carbon leaves forest as lumber)
- Prevent soil disturbance (soil carbon remains stored)
- Manage for species with high carbon sequestration rates
- Avoid frequent burning (releases stored carbon)
- Plant new trees in open areas

**Indicators of success:**
- Above-ground biomass (tons/acre)
- Below-ground carbon (soil organic matter)
- Carbon credit certifications (VCS, Gold Standard, etc.)
- Annual sequestration rate (tons CO2/acre/year)

**Timeline:** Visible accumulation in 5-10 years; peak storage 50+ years for old growth

**Conflicts with:**
- **Timber revenue** — Can't harvest trees if you're storing them for carbon
- **Fire management** — Prescribed burns release stored carbon
- **Recreation access** — Dense forest limits trail development

**Cost profile:**
- Monitoring/certification: $1,000-2,000/year
- Planting (if done): $500-1,500/acre
- Revenue from carbon credits: Highly variable ($5-25/ton CO2 equivalent)
- Typical forest: 2-5 tons CO2/acre/year sequestration

---

#### 4. Recreation & Access

**Definition:** Provide opportunities for hiking, hunting, wildlife watching, or other outdoor recreation while maintaining forest health.

**Methods:**
- Build and maintain trails
- Create parking areas and access points
- Manage view corridors for scenic value
- Allow hunting season access
- Maintain open understory for hiking
- Install signage and trail markers

**Indicators of success:**
- Trail condition and maintenance status
- Usage level (foot traffic, wildlife sign)
- User satisfaction (if surveyed)
- Variety of recreational opportunities
- Safety (trail accidents, property damage)

**Timeline:** Can be seasonal; trails usable year-round with maintenance

**Conflicts with:**
- **Wildlife habitat** — Human presence disrupts wildlife; trails fragment habitat
- **Carbon sequestration** — Trail building disturbs soil; forest management for recreation may prevent dense growth
- **Timber revenue** — Recreation areas can't be harvested

**Cost profile:**
- Trail construction: $500-2,000/mile (depending on terrain)
- Annual maintenance: $200-500/mile
- Signage/parking: $1,000-5,000
- Liability insurance: $500-2,000/year

---

#### 5. Biodiversity & Ecological Resilience

**Definition:** Maintain genetic, species, and structural diversity to create a forest resilient to climate change, pests, and diseases.

**Methods:**
- Maintain multiple tree species (not monoculture)
- Protect large patches of contiguous forest
- Maintain connectivity to other protected lands
- Manage for structural complexity (different ages and sizes)
- Reduce pest/disease vulnerability through diversity
- Preserve rare or threatened species habitat

**Indicators of success:**
- Number of tree species present
- Age structure distribution
- Genetic diversity within species
- Patch size and connectivity
- Presence of rare/threatened species

**Timeline:** Visible diversity building in 10-20 years; full resilience 50+ years

**Conflicts with:**
- **Timber revenue** — Single-species plantations are highest-yield timber but lowest diversity
- **Aesthetic value** — Complex structure is "messy" rather than tidy
- **Recreation** — Dense diversity may limit trail access

**Cost profile:**
- Inventory/monitoring: $2,000-4,000/year
- Active management (planting, tending): $2,000-5,000/year
- Restoration (invasive removal): $3,000-8,000/year

---

#### 6. Aesthetic Value & Landscape Character

**Definition:** Maintain or enhance the visual beauty of the forest and preserve its character for the owner and neighbors.

**Methods:**
- Thin overstory to open views
- Maintain forest openings and meadows
- Remove "ugly" deadwood and snags
- Manage for specific forest types (open understory, old-growth character, etc.)
- Preserve scenic corridors and viewpoints

**Indicators of success:**
- Photo documentation of forest appearance
- Owner satisfaction with landscape
- Neighbor feedback
- Ecological diversity and structure (if integrated with biodiversity goal)

**Timeline:** Visible in 1-3 years; continuous maintenance

**Conflicts with:**
- **Wildlife habitat** — Snags and deadwood are essential habitat but "ugly"
- **Carbon sequestration** — Thinning removes biomass/carbon
- **Biodiversity** — Aesthetic management often means simplification

**Cost profile:**
- Regular pruning/thinning: $1,000-3,000/year
- Large-scale thinning: $800-1,500/acre
- Professional consultation: $100-200/hour

---

#### 7. Legacy & Succession Planning

**Definition:** Establish a forest in excellent condition for future generations, with management plans and conservation protections in place.

**Methods:**
- Build financial reserves for management continuity
- Document management history and plans (for heirs/successors)
- Establish conservation easements (legal protection)
- Create fund or trust for ongoing management
- Reduce owner's financial burden through long-term planning

**Indicators of success:**
- Legal documents in place (will, easement, trust)
- Financial reserves established
- Management plan documented and transferable
- Forest condition improving or stable over decades
- Clear communication to heirs about stewardship values

**Timeline:** Planning now; payoff 20-50+ years

**Conflicts with:**
- Timber revenue now (may sacrifice short-term income for long-term health)
- Aesthetic preferences (may prioritize forest health over appearance)

**Cost profile:**
- Legal consultation: $2,000-5,000 (one-time)
- Trust/foundation setup: $5,000-15,000 (one-time)
- Annual management: $3,000-10,000/year (varies)
- Conservation easement: Often grants available to offset costs

### Goal-Setting Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to clarify priorities and identify realistic goal combinations for your forest.

| Goal | Revenue Impact | Cost | Timeline to Results | Effort Level | Conflicts with |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wildlife Habitat | Minimal | Moderate | 5-10 years | Moderate | Timber, Aesthetics |
| Timber Revenue | High | Moderate | 10-40 years | Low | Wildlife, Carbon |
| Carbon Storage | Minimal | Low | 10+ years | Low | Timber, Fire |
| Recreation | Negative | Moderate | 1-2 years | Moderate | Wildlife |
| Biodiversity | Minimal | Moderate-High | 20+ years | High | Timber, Aesthetics |
| Aesthetics | Negative | Moderate | 1-3 years | Moderate | Wildlife, Biodiversity |
| Legacy | Negative (now) | High | 50+ years | High | Timber (now) |

**How to use this:**
1. Pick your top 3 goals
2. Scan the "Conflicts with" column
3. If all three conflict heavily, expect trade-offs
4. Focus planning on synergies (goals that support each other)

**Common realistic combinations:**
- **Timber + Legacy:** Sustain revenue while building for next generation
- **Wildlife + Recreation:** Active management balances habitat with access
- **Carbon + Aesthetics:** Both favor keeping mature forest intact
- **Wildlife + Biodiversity + Legacy:** Long-term stewardship focus
- **Timber + Aesthetics:** Active management, selective cutting

## Part 3: Scenario Modeling Framework

### Approach: Multi-Horizon, Multi-Strategy Analysis

Scenario modeling helps you understand long-term consequences of different management approaches. This framework guides how to structure and compare scenarios.

#### Setup Phase

**Time horizons to model:**
1. **10-year horizon** — Near enough to see management impact, far enough to escape year-to-year variation
2. **20-year horizon** — Medium-term forest transformation
3. **50-year horizon** — Long-term legacy, climate change effects, successor generation

**Strategies to compare:**
1. **Status Quo (Minimal Intervention)** — No management, let succession proceed naturally
2. **Wildlife-Focused** — Optimize for habitat, connectivity, biodiversity
3. **Timber-Focused** — Optimize for revenue through regular harvesting
4. **Carbon-Focused** — Maximize carbon storage, minimize disturbance
5. **Balanced/Hybrid** — Attempt to balance multiple goals
6. **[Your custom strategy]** — Any other approach you want to explore

#### Key Variables to Model for Each Scenario

**Forest composition:**
- Tree species distribution (% oak, maple, pine, etc.)
- Age structure (proportion of trees in age classes: 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60+)
- Density (trees per acre)
- Basal area (total stem cross-section, indicator of stand productivity)

**Ecological metrics:**
- Wildlife habitat suitability score (1-10 for different species)
- Biodiversity index (species richness, Shannon diversity)
- Carbon storage (tons/acre above-ground, below-ground)
- Resilience to drought, pests, disease (qualitative assessment)

**Economic metrics:**
- Cumulative revenue (timber, ecosystem service credits, grants)
- Cumulative costs (management labor, equipment, permits)
- Net present value (discounted total revenue - costs)
- Annual cash flow (varies by year)

**Other metrics:**
- Recreational value (trail accessibility, scenic quality)
- Fire risk (fuel load, ladder fuels, catastrophic fire probability)
- Invasive species prevalence
- View/aesthetic character

#### Baseline (Current Condition)

**Start with accurate current data from Forest Analyst:**
- Stand age, species composition, health
- Current stocking/density
- Known issues (pests, disease, invasive species)
- Current management status
- Recent history (what's been done, how did forest respond?)

**This year 0 for all scenarios.**

#### Modeling Logic for Each 10-Year Interval

**Growth component:**
- Healthy trees grow at species-specific rates (use forestry growth models or research averages)
- Diseased/weak trees may not grow or may die
- Competition reduces growth if stocking is high
- Drought years reduce growth; favorable years increase growth

**Management component:**
- In timber-focused scenario: Harvest X% of timber during favorable market window
- In wildlife-focused scenario: Thin for structure, remove invasives
- In carbon-focused scenario: No harvest, plant native species in openings
- In status quo: No intervention

**Disturbance component:**
- Pest/disease events (based on probability, forest condition)
- Weather events (storms, drought, ice storms)
- Fire (natural or prescribed burn)
- Invasive species spread

**Outcome:**
- Updated forest composition, age structure, metrics
- Revenue or costs from this interval
- Success against goals

#### Handling Uncertainty

**Forests are unpredictable. Represent uncertainty by:**

1. **Best case / Expected / Worst case** — Model three versions of each scenario
   - Best case: Favorable weather, good markets, no pest outbreaks
   - Expected: Average conditions, moderate markets, typical pest pressure
   - Worst case: Drought or storms, poor markets, major pest outbreak

2. **Probability ranges** — Where possible, assign probabilities
   - "80% probability this scenario yields $X revenue"
   - "Forest has 20% chance of major pest outbreak by year 20"

3. **Sensitivity analysis** — Identify which variables matter most
   - "If timber prices drop 30%, strategy A becomes uneconomical"
   - "If climate shifts to longer droughts, strategy A fails; strategy B succeeds"

#### Scenario Model Template

**SCENARIO: [Name]**

**Management approach:** [Describe how this scenario differs from status quo]

**10-Year Projection:**
- Forest composition: [Species % changes]
- Average tree age: [From X to Y years]
- Wildlife habitat score: [From X to Y, rated 1-10]
- Timber volume available: [X cords/board feet]
- Carbon storage: [X tons CO2 equivalent]
- Revenue: $[X] (if timber or carbon credits)
- Costs: $[X]
- Net: $[X]
- Risk events: [Likely pest, weather, fire scenarios]

**20-Year Projection:** [Same structure]

**50-Year Projection:** [Same structure, noting climate change assumptions]

**Summary assessment:**
- Alignment with your goals: [Rate 1-10 for each goal]
- Vulnerabilities: [What could derail this scenario?]
- Reversibility: [Can you pivot to a different strategy later?]
- Overall success: [Does this scenario achieve your vision?]

## Part 4: Management Action Catalog

Reference guide for common forest management activities. Includes typical timing, costs, and expected ecological effects.

### Thinning (Selective Harvest of Small/Weak Trees)

**Description:** Remove 20-40% of trees per acre, targeting weak, diseased, or competing stems. Leaves the forest structure largely intact but reduces crowding.

**Ecological effects:**
- Increased light to remaining trees → improved growth
- Reduced competition for water → drought resilience
- Maintained wildlife habitat structure
- Improved understory development
- Reduced pest/disease pressure (more air circulation)

**Timing window:** Fall/winter (dry soil, dormant season is best for forest)

**Cost:** $600-1,200/acre (labor and equipment)

**Revenue potential:** $300-800/acre (small-diameter timber or firewood sales)

**Timeline:** 1-2 years to see growth response; 10-15 year cycles

**Reversibility:** Moderate—can let thinned stand grow back, but removed trees are gone

**Best for:** Crowded young stands, stands recovering from damage, any stand where reducing competition improves health

---

### Shelterwood Harvest

**Description:** Remove overstory in 2-3 stages over 10-20 years, creating regeneration opportunities in the understory while maintaining partial shade.

**Ecological effects:**
- Allows regeneration of shade-intolerant species (oak, pine)
- Maintains structural complexity
- Good wildlife habitat during regeneration phase
- Soil disturbance moderate

**Timing window:** Multiple entries over decades; each entry timing depends on regeneration readiness

**Cost:** $1,000-2,000/acre total (spread over multiple harvests)

**Revenue potential:** $1,500-3,500/acre total (spread over multiple harvests)

**Timeline:** 20-30+ years for full cycle

**Reversibility:** Difficult—represents major structural change

**Best for:** Transitioning to new species composition, complex stands, situations requiring gradual change

---

### Clearcut & Replant

**Description:** Remove all trees in a patch (typically 1-5 acres), prepare site, and plant new seedlings. Results in uniform age-class cohort.

**Ecological effects:**
- Maximum light to regeneration
- Highest timber yield per unit time
- Simplifies forest structure
- Pioneer species colonize; later-successional species return slowly
- Highest soil disturbance, highest erosion risk
- Full habitat disruption for 10-15 years, then recovery

**Timing window:** Winter preferred (minimize soil damage)

**Cost:** $500-1,500/acre removal + $300-800/acre site prep and planting = $800-2,300/acre total

**Revenue potential:** $2,000-5,000/acre (depends on timber value at harvest)

**Timeline:** 40-60+ years to next harvest (depending on species)

**Reversibility:** Very difficult—represents 40-60 year commitment

**Best for:** Extremely poor-condition stands, economic timber production, situations requiring rapid regeneration

---

### Invasive Species Removal

**Description:** Manual, mechanical, or chemical removal of non-native species (garlic mustard, Japanese stiltgrass, multiflora rose, emerald ash borer impacts, etc.).

**Ecological effects:**
- Reduces competition against native species
- Improves habitat diversity and quality
- Restores soil conditions (some invasives alter soil chemistry)
- May take many years and multiple entries

**Timing window:** Species-dependent; typically spring or early summer when plants are actively growing

**Cost:** $1,000-5,000 per project depending on infestation extent; highly variable

**Revenue potential:** None typically (unless selling removed biomass, rare)

**Timeline:** 3-10 years for meaningful impact depending on invasive; many require ongoing management

**Reversibility:** High—invasives often re-establish, requiring repeated treatments

**Best for:** Maintaining forest health, protecting rare native species, improving habitat quality

---

### Prescribed Burn

**Description:** Controlled fire under managed conditions (spring, fall, specific weather window) to reduce fuel load, manage succession, or promote specific fire-adapted species.

**Ecological effects:**
- Reduces dead fuel and understory biomass
- Reduces pest/disease (some pathogens sensitive to fire)
- Promotes oak/pine regeneration (fire-adapted species)
- Returns nutrients to soil
- Temporarily disrupts wildlife, then benefit as new growth emerges
- Carbon release (store elsewhere, though some stays in soil)

**Timing window:** Spring (March-May) or fall (Sept-Nov); narrow windows when fuel moisture and weather are right

**Cost:** $500-2,000/acre (professional burn crew, equipment, post-burn monitoring)

**Revenue potential:** None typically

**Timeline:** Effects visible in 1-2 years; full benefits take 5-10 years

**Reversibility:** Moderate—landscape recovers, but full recovery takes years

**Best for:** Fire-adapted ecosystems (oak savannas, pine stands), fuel reduction, mimicking historical disturbance

---

### Wildlife Habitat Improvements

**Description:** Targeted actions to improve habitat for specific wildlife (snags for cavity-nesting birds, brush piles for small mammals, mast trees for deer, water features, etc.).

**Ecological effects:**
- Increases habitat suitability for target species
- Often improves structure/diversity incidentally
- Benefits cascade (predators follow prey, etc.)
- Soil disturbance minimal to moderate

**Timing window:** Varies by action; deadwood leaving doesn't need season; den tree creation needs planning

**Cost:** $500-3,000/acre or highly variable depending on action

**Revenue potential:** None typically

**Timeline:** 1-5 years to see wildlife colonization

**Reversibility:** High for most actions

**Best for:** Maximizing biodiversity, supporting specific conservation priorities

---

### Road Construction/Maintenance

**Description:** Build or upgrade forest roads for access to management areas, harvest operations, or recreation.

**Ecological effects:**
- Soil disturbance, erosion risk if poorly designed
- Habitat fragmentation (can be mitigated with wildlife crossings, etc.)
- Improved access for monitoring, emergency response
- Long-term impact depends on road design and maintenance

**Timing window:** Summer/fall when soil is dry; avoid wet season to minimize damage

**Cost:** $2,000-5,000/mile for new road; $300-800/mile annual maintenance

**Revenue potential:** None (enable other activities)

**Timeline:** Immediate access; long-term maintenance commitment

**Reversibility:** Difficult—roads are semi-permanent infrastructure

**Best for:** Essential access for forest management or recreation

---

### Trail Development & Maintenance

**Description:** Create or improve hiking/recreation trails for public or private use.

**Ecological effects:**
- Minimal direct disturbance if well-designed
- Can concentrate human foot traffic, protecting other areas
- May fragment habitat or disturb wildlife if poorly designed
- Erosion risk if poorly maintained

**Timing window:** Summer/fall for construction; spring/fall for maintenance

**Cost:** $500-2,000/mile for new trail; $200-400/mile annual maintenance

**Revenue potential:** None typically (enable recreation activity)

**Timeline:** 1-3 years to full development; ongoing maintenance

**Reversibility:** High—can be reclaimed if abandoned

**Best for:** Balancing recreation with forest management, concentrating use away from sensitive areas

---

### Native Species Planting

**Description:** Plant locally-appropriate native seedlings to restore species diversity, fill gaps, or establish desired age structure.

**Ecological effects:**
- Increases forest diversity
- Accelerates recovery in degraded areas
- Maintains genetic diversity of species adapted to local conditions
- May require ongoing maintenance (weeding, watering) for first few years

**Timing window:** Spring (April-May) for best survival; fall planting less reliable

**Cost:** $50-200/seedling (including labor); typically $3,000-8,000/acre for full restoration

**Revenue potential:** None typically (20+ year wait to harvest)

**Timeline:** 3-5 years to establish; 15-20 years to meaningful forest contribution

**Reversibility:** Moderate—plantings can fail or be removed, but once established, are long-term

**Best for:** Species restoration, diversity improvement, long-term forest legacy

---

## Part 5: Seasonal Calendar Template for Eastern US Forests

Customize this calendar for your specific forest and goals. Note key activities, deadlines, and optimal timing windows.

### Planting Season Windows

- Timing: [Was the season right? Should you try different season next time?]
- Contractor/labor: [Quality, reliability, efficiency]

**Impact on goals:**
- Wildlife habitat: [Did habitat improve as expected?]
- Timber production: [Revenue realistic? Market timing?]
- Carbon: [Did carbon storage change as expected?]
- Aesthetics: [Visual result matches expectations?]
- Recreation access: [Impact on trails, access?]
- Biodiversity: [Any new species observed?]

**Adaptive management adjustments:** [How should you modify the plan based on this outcome?]

**Next steps:** [What's the follow-up action?]

**Example entry:**

**Date completed:** 2026-08-15

**Action type:** Thinning

**Location:** North stand, 8 acres

**Action description:** Marked and removed all trees <6" diameter and weak/diseased stems; ~500 trees removed; 80% oaks and maples retained

**Planned outcome:** Reduce competition, improve growth, create more light to understory

**Actual outcome:** Successfully thinned to ~100 trees/acre from ~200; light dramatically increased

**Cost actual:** $8,200 (labor, equipment, crew meals) vs. Budgeted $8,000

**Success vs. plan:** Mostly successful

**Key observations:**
- Tree response: Clear stems show good growth potential; less crown damage than anticipated
- Wildlife response: Deer tracks immediately present, foraging on new understory growth; bird activity unchanged during/after
- Soil/understory: Garlic mustard returning; blackberry and native fern sprouting where shade reduced
- Unexpected issues: Discovered 30 dead ash trees (likely EAB); marked for removal next year; stumpage value lower than expected due to elm material

**Lessons learned:**
- What worked well: Phased thinning worked; crew did clean work; marking system was clear
- What to improve: Should have addressed invasive species (garlic mustard) before thinning; lighter follow-up needed in year 2
- Timing: August harvest caused more stump sprouting than would fall cut; recommend shift to late Oct
- Contractor/labor: Crew was efficient and safety-conscious; recommend same team for follow-up

**Impact on goals:**
- Wildlife habitat: Improved—new food sources from increased understory
- Timber production: Reduced near-term (removed merchantable timber) but improved long-term growth potential
- Carbon: Decreased short-term (trees removed) but long-term storage likely improved due to healthier remaining trees
- Aesthetics: Improved—understory now visible, more "open" forest character
- Recreation access: No impact (no trails in this stand)
- Biodiversity: Moderate improvement—new plant growth, but monitoring for invasive response needed

**Adaptive management adjustments:**
- Plan year 2 follow-up focused on invasive removal before understory establishes
- Shift harvest window to Oct-Nov for future thinning (reduce stump sprouting)
- Revisit 30 dead ash trees removal timing and method

**Next steps:** Spring 2027 invasive removal and continued monitoring of growth response

## Part 7: Integration with Other Agents

The Stewardship Planner orchestrates inputs from five other specialized agents. This section clarifies what to ask of each and how to interpret their outputs.

### When to query Research Scout

**Ask for:**
- Scientific studies on a specific management practice (e.g., "What does research say about thinning effects on oak regeneration?")
- Species-specific information (e.g., "What are white oak's growth rates in this region?")
- Ecological impacts of a management action (e.g., "How do prescribed burns affect soil carbon?")
- Best practices from peer-reviewed literature

**Interpret their output:**
- Look for studies specific to your region/forest type
- Distinguish between "theoretically optimal" and "practically achievable"
- Note uncertainty—research often identifies trade-offs, not clear winners
- Ask follow-up questions if research is unclear or contradictory

### When to query Forest Analyst

**Ask for:**
- Current stand condition (species, age, health, stocking)
- Accessibility (can this stand be harvested? Are soils steep/wet?)
- Problem identification (pests, disease, invasive species present?)
- Growth potential (what is this stand capable of?)

**Interpret their output:**
- Take their data as ground truth (measured, not estimated)
- Note data freshness (when was last inventory?)
- Identify gaps (parts of forest not recently surveyed?)
- Use their condition assessment to prioritize management priorities

### When to query Financial Tracker

**Ask for:**
- Cost estimates for specific management actions
- Timber market prices (current and historical trends)
- Potential revenue from harvest/carbon credits
- Financial comparison of two management scenarios

**Interpret their output:**
- Distinguish between "average" and "typical for your region"
- Note timing sensitivity (market prices fluctuate; timing matters)
- Consider market risk (commodity prices are volatile)
- Remember long-term planning shouldn't be driven by short-term market fluctuations

### When to query Corporate Advisor

**Ask for:**
- Regulatory compliance requirements for an action (harvesting permits, etc.)
- Tax implications (cost-share, conservation easement, timber sales taxation)
- Certification requirements (FSC, SFI, etc.)
- Legal constraints (deed restrictions, easement limitations)

**Interpret their output:**
- Confirm their advice with an actual attorney if legally/financially significant
- Note compliance deadlines
- Identify which certifications matter for your goals
- Understand long-term legal implications of decisions (easements, trusts, wills)

### When to query Data Collector

**Ask for:**
- Data freshness assessment (how current is the forest inventory?)
- Data gaps (where do we need new information?)
- Data quality issues (what should we verify?)
- Recommendations for new monitoring/data collection

**Interpret their output:**
- Prioritize new data collection based on decision-relevance (collect data that matters for your decisions)
- Don't obsess over perfect data; good data + action beats perfect data + paralysis
- Use their recommendations to prioritize monitoring budget
