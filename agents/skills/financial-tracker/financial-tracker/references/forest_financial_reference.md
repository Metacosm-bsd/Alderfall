## Regional Stumpage Prices

Stumpage price is what a timber buyer pays for trees still standing on your land (per unit: board feet for sawlogs, cords for pulpwood, tons for biomass).

**These are typical ranges for the eastern U.S. (2024-2025 estimates). Prices vary by:**
- Species and grade
- Local market demand
- Transportation distance to mills
- Log quality and size
- Current economic conditions

**Always verify with local timber buyers or a forester for your specific region.**

### Hardwood Species (Eastern U.S.)

| Species | Grade | Unit | Low | High | Notes |
|---------|-------|------|-----|------|-------|
| Red Oak | Saw | $/MBF | $300 | $600 | Veneer-grade premium; varies by log size |
| White Oak | Saw | $/MBF | $350 | $700 | Higher value, slower growth; strong market |
| Maple (Hard) | Saw | $/MBF | $250 | $500 | Flooring, furniture demand |
| Ash | Saw | $/MBF | $150 | $400 | Market depressed by emerald ash borer |
| Walnut | Saw | $/MBF | $600 | $1200 | Premium species; veneer very high |
| Cherry | Saw | $/MBF | $300 | $600 | Furniture and cabinet grade |
| Poplar (Yellow) | Saw | $/MBF | $100 | $250 | Lower value; pulpwood alternative |
| Hickory | Saw | $/MBF | $200 | $400 | Tool handles, smoking wood |
| Birch | Saw | $/MBF | $200 | $400 | Plywood, furniture |

### Softwood Species (Eastern U.S.)

| Species | Grade | Unit | Low | High | Notes |
|---------|-------|------|-----|------|-------|
| Pine (Eastern White) | Saw | $/MBF | $250 | $450 | Good yields; utility to select grade |
| Pine (Loblolly) | Saw | $/MBF | $200 | $400 | Southern pine; varies by size class |
| Spruce | Saw | $/MBF | $150 | $350 | Lighter wood; construction lumber |
| Fir (Eastern) | Saw | $/MBF | $150 | $350 | Utility lumber market |
| Hemlock | Saw | $/MBF | $100 | $250 | Lower value; sometimes used for pulp |

### Pulpwood & Biomass (Per Cord or Ton)

| Category | Unit | Low | High | Notes |
|----------|------|-----|------|-------|

| Softwood Pulp | $/cord | $25 | $60 | Pine, spruce, fir |
| Wood Chips (delivered) | $/ton | $30 | $80 | From larger operations |
| Biomass/Energy Wood | $/cord | $15 | $40 | Low-grade material; varies by power plant |

### How to Convert Between Units

- 1 MBF (thousand board feet) = 2.36 cords (approximate) for hardwoods
- Sawlog conversion depends on species and processing method (typically 40-50% of gross volume becomes usable lumber)
- Small logs and residuals may be sold as pulpwood or biomass at lower prices
- Always ask the buyer what units and specifications they use (log length, diameter, grade)

## Tax Reference

### Section 1231 Capital Gains Treatment

**What is Section 1231?**

Section 1231 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows timber (held >1 year) to be taxed at long-term capital gains rates rather than ordinary income rates. This is a significant tax advantage.

**Key points:**

- **Holding period:** Timber must be held for more than 1 year to qualify
- **Tax rate:** Long-term capital gains (15-20% federal) vs. ordinary income rates (up to 37% federal)
- **What qualifies:** Income from the sale of standing timber or cut logs (if you're not a timber dealer)
- **Non-qualifying:** If you're classified as a "timber dealer" (business is buying/selling timber), gains are ordinary income

**Example:**
- You sell $50,000 of timber that you've held for 3 years
- Ordinary income tax (37% bracket): $18,500 tax
- Long-term capital gains (20% rate): $10,000 tax
- **Tax savings: $8,500**

**Important:** Consult your CPA to confirm your timber is held for investment (not business inventory).

---

### Reforestation Deduction

**What is the Reforestation Deduction?**

Landowners can deduct reforestation costs at an accelerated rate under Section 194 of the Tax Code, rather than capitalizing them.

**Key provisions:**

- **Annual deduction limit:** Up to $10,000 per year per landowner (or $20,000 married filing jointly for some situations)
- **Qualifying costs:** Direct costs of reforestation (seedlings, planting labor, site prep) on land you own for forest use
- **Non-qualifying:** Maintenance, fertilizer after establishment, road work, consulting
- **Carry-forward:** Unused deductions carry forward indefinitely

**Example:**
- You spend $8,000 replanting an acre in 2024
- Deduction: $8,000 in 2024 (reduces ordinary income in that year)
- In 2025, you spend $6,000 more: you can deduct $6,000 (taking your total to within the $10,000 annual limit)
- In 2026, you spend $5,000: you can deduct $5,000, but you've now used $19,000 over three years... actually, you deduct $2,000 in 2026 to hit the annual cap, and carry forward $3,000 to 2027

**Tracking:** Keep detailed receipts for all reforestation work (date, what was done, cost, acreage).

### Conservation Easement Tax Benefits

**What is a Conservation Easement?**

A conservation easement is a permanent restriction on development or certain land uses. In exchange, you can claim a charitable deduction.

**Tax advantage:**

- **Charitable deduction:** You can deduct the difference between the property's full value and its restricted-use value
- **Example:** Property worth $500,000; restricted value $300,000; charitable deduction = $200,000
- **Income offset:** The deduction reduces your taxable income in that year (and carry-forward years if deduction is large)
- **Capital gains reduction:** Future timber sales may have lower capital gains if the conservation easement restricts harvesting

**Process:**

1. Have the property appraised (full value and restricted value)
2. Donate the easement to a qualified conservation organization or land trust
3. Claim the deduction on Schedule A; high-income earners get special multi-year carry-forward
4. Get a Tax Form 8283 signed by the appraiser

**Important:** This is complex and requires professional guidance. Consult a tax advisor and conservation attorney.

---

### Property Tax Considerations

**Forest property may qualify for lower tax rates:**

- **Preferential assessment:** Many states tax productive forest land at lower rates than developed land (based on use, not development potential)
- **Eligibility:** Varies by state; often requires 10+ acres, management plan, or income from timber
- **Application:** Typically filed with county assessor; prove forest use

**Deductible management expenses:**

- Property tax on the forest land (state/county)
- Timber management expenses (labor, equipment, contractors)
- Professional services (forester, accountant)
- Road maintenance, culverts, bridges
- Pest/disease treatment
- Equipment depreciation (tractors, chainsaws)

**Non-deductible:**

- Personal use (hiking cabin on property)
- Mortgage interest (unless investment property)
- General liability insurance (though may have business use portion)

## Carbon Credit Markets

### Overview

Forests can generate income from carbon credits—payments for storing carbon (CO2) or preventing emissions. There are two main markets: regulatory (mandatory) and voluntary.

### Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM)

**What it is:** Individuals and companies voluntarily purchase carbon offsets to voluntarily reduce emissions. No government mandate.

**Forest credits:**

- **Afforestation:** Planting trees on previously non-forested land
- **Reforestation:** Replanting harvested or natural disturbance areas
- **Improved forest management (IFM):** Thinning, reducing harvest rates, extending rotation length to store more carbon
- **Avoided conversion:** Conserving forests that might otherwise be cleared

**Price ranges:**
- $5-$20/ton of CO2 equivalent (typical for quality forest projects)
- Higher prices ($20-$30+) for premium verified projects
- Prices vary by vintage (year issued) and verification standard

**Project requirements:**

- **Additionality:** The project must not happen without the carbon payment
- **Permanence:** Forest must remain for 40-100 years (depending on standard)
- **Verification:** Third-party auditor certifies carbon stored annually
- **Documentation:** Records of baseline, activities, and monitoring

**Common standards:**
- Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) / Verra
- American Carbon Registry (ACR)
- Plan Vivo (small-scale, community projects)
- Gold Standard

**Typical timeline:**
1. Baseline project design (cost: $2,000-$10,000; forester + consultant)
2. Validation (third-party review): 2-4 months
3. Project monitoring and recording (ongoing)
4. Verification audit (annually): $3,000-$10,000
5. Credit issuance (tCO2e—metric tons CO2 equivalent)
6. Sale to buyer

### Regulatory Markets

**Examples:** EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), California cap-and-trade (not open to forest owners directly, but offsets accepted)

**Forest offset programs (U.S.):**
- California Compliance Offset Program (limited to specific IFM activities in eligible regions)
- ACR and VCS projects sold into regulatory demand

**Pricing:** Generally higher than voluntary market ($30-$100+), but more complex eligibility and documentation.

### Carbon Quantification (Simplified)

**Rough estimate for eastern deciduous forest:**

- **Growing forest:** 1-2 tons CO2/acre/year stored in growing trees (net sequestration after respiration and decomposition)
- **Mature forest:** ~0.5-1 ton CO2/acre/year maintained/stored
- **Thinned forest:** May increase sequestration if growth accelerates

**For reforestation on 10 acres planted in year 1:**
- Year 1-20: Average ~1 ton CO2/acre/year = 10 tons/year
- Total over 20 years: ~200 tCO2e
- At $10/ton: $2,000 revenue
- At $15/ton: $3,000 revenue
- Less verification costs ($3,000-$5,000/verification over 5 years): ~$600-$1,000/year net

**Key point:** Carbon markets provide supplemental income, not a primary revenue source for most small forests.

## Financial Formulas

### 1. Net Present Value (NPV)

**Formula:**
```
NPV = -C₀ + (CF₁ / (1+r)¹) + (CF₂ / (1+r)²) + ... + (CFₙ / (1+r)ⁿ)
```

Where:
- C₀ = Initial investment cost (year 0)
- CFₜ = Cash flow in year t
- r = Discount rate (typically 2-4% for forestry)
- n = Number of years

**What it means:** NPV > 0 means the investment is worth doing (returns exceed costs in today's dollars). Higher NPV = better investment.

**Example: Thinning decision**

- Year 0: Spend $3,000 to thin 5 acres
- Year 15: Sell timber from thinned area for $15,000
- Discount rate: 3%
- NPV = -$3,000 + ($15,000 / (1.03)^15)
- NPV = -$3,000 + ($15,000 / 1.558)
- NPV = -$3,000 + $9,630
- NPV = $6,630

**Result:** Positive NPV; the thinning is financially justified.

---

### 2. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**Concept:** The annual return rate that makes NPV = 0. In other words, the "yield" of your forest investment.

**Formula:** Solve for r when NPV = 0:
```
0 = -C₀ + (CF₁ / (1+r)¹) + (CF₂ / (1+r)²) + ... + (CFₙ / (1+r)ⁿ)
```

(Usually solved using spreadsheet or financial calculator; no simple algebraic solution.)

**What it means:** If IRR > your required return (e.g., 3%), the investment is acceptable.

**Example (same thinning):**
- Initial cost: $3,000 (year 0)
- Revenue: $15,000 (year 15)
- IRR ≈ 8.5% (solving the equation above)

**Result:** 8.5% annual return exceeds typical 3% forest investment benchmark; good deal.

---

### 3. Land Expectation Value (LEV)

**Formula:**
```
LEV = [Revenue / ((1+r)^n - 1)] - [(Mgmt Cost × ((1+r)^n - 1)) / (r × ((1+r)^n - 1))]
```

Simplified for infinite rotations:
```
LEV = [Revenue - (Mgmt Cost per year × 1/r)] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
```

Where:
- Revenue = Timber sale value at harvest
- Mgmt Cost = Annual management cost (avg per year)
- r = Discount rate
- n = Rotation length (years to harvest)

**What it means:** The present value of the land assuming infinite cycles of the same management. Used to compare different management strategies on the same land.

**Example:**
- Rotation: 50 years
- Harvest revenue: $50,000 (per acre)
- Annual management cost: $50/acre/year
- Discount rate: 3%

```
LEV = [50,000 - (50 × 1/0.03)] / [(1.03)^50 - 1]
LEV = [50,000 - 1,667] / [4.384 - 1]
LEV = 48,333 / 3.384
LEV ≈ $14,280 per acre
```

**Use:** Compare this to alternative management (e.g., longer rotation, different species, conservation easement) to find optimal strategy.

---

### 4. Compound Annual Growth (CAG)

**Formula:**
```
Future Value = Present Value × (1 + g)^n
```

Or solving for g:
```
g = (Future Value / Present Value)^(1/n) - 1
```

Where:
- g = Annual growth rate
- n = Number of years

**What it means:** How fast timber volume (or value) is increasing.

**Example:**
- Stand volume today: 15,000 board feet per acre
- Expected volume in 20 years: 25,000 board feet per acre
- Growth rate: (25,000 / 15,000)^(1/20) - 1 = (1.667)^0.05 - 1 ≈ 2.6% per year

**Use:** Forecast future harvest volumes or compare growth rates across stands (younger stands often grow faster).

---

### 5. Stumpage Value to Harvest Revenue Conversion

**Formula:**
```
Net Harvest Revenue = Stumpage Value - Harvest Costs
```

Or:
```
Harvest Cost as % = (Harvest Costs / Stumpage Value) × 100
```

**Typical scenario:**
- Stumpage price: $400/MBF (from regional market)
- Stand volume: 10,000 board feet per acre
- Gross stumpage value (per acre): $400 × 10 = $4,000

But you must subtract:
- Felling & bucking: 15% × $4,000 = $600
- Skidding: 20% × $4,000 = $800
- Road work & equipment: 10% × $4,000 = $400
- Contractor margin: 5% × $4,000 = $200

Total costs: $2,000

**Net revenue to you: $4,000 - $2,000 = $2,000 per acre**

---

### 6. Carbon Sequestration Value (Simple)

**Formula:**
```
Annual Carbon Income = (Tons CO2/acre/year) × (Price per ton) - Verification Costs
```

**Example:**
- Sequestration rate: 1.5 tons CO2/acre/year
- Carbon price: $12/ton
- Verification cost (annual): $500 / 100 acres = $5/acre

Annual income per acre: (1.5 × $12) - $5 = $18 - $5 = **$13/acre/year**

Over 25 years: $13 × 25 = $325/acre (present value ~$250 at 3% discount rate)

---

### 7. Timber Value Growth Over Time

**Formula:**
```
Future Timber Value = (Current Volume × Growth Rate^years) × (Price at harvest)
```

**Example:**
- Current stand: 8,000 board feet/acre
- Annual growth: 2.5% per year
- Time to harvest: 10 years
- Expected price at harvest: $450/MBF

```
Future volume = 8,000 × (1.025)^10 = 8,000 × 1.280 = 10,240 BF/acre
Future timber value = 10,240 × $450 = $4,608 per acre
```

**Note:** This is gross value; still subtract harvest costs to get net revenue.

## How to Use These References in Analysis

**When evaluating a timber sale:**
1. Get inventory data (volume, species, grade)
2. Apply regional stumpage price from the table
3. Calculate gross value: Volume × Price
4. Subtract harvest costs (use 30-50% benchmark or get quotes)
5. Calculate net value to you

**When planning a management action:**
1. Estimate upfront cost (use benchmarks or get quotes)
2. Estimate future revenue (growth formula + expected price)
3. Calculate NPV at 3% discount rate
4. If NPV > 0, it's financially justified

**When assessing forest value:**
1. Use Land Expectation Value for infinite-rotation comparison
2. Account for multiple revenue streams (timber + carbon + conservation easement)
3. Consider non-financial values (wildlife, recreation, water quality)
