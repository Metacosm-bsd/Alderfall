## 1. Ecology & Silviculture
The science of how forests grow, regenerate, and respond to management.

**Key subtopics:**
- Close-to-Nature Forestry (CNF) — management that mimics natural processes
- Adaptive management — treating management actions as experiments
- Stand dynamics — how tree stands change over time (succession, competition, mortality)
- Silvicultural prescriptions — thinning, selective harvest, shelterwood, seed tree methods
- Regeneration — natural vs. artificial, species selection, site preparation
- Forest health — disease, insects, drought stress, wind damage
- Invasive species — identification, prevention, management
- Fire ecology — fire regimes, prescribed burns, fuel management
- Soil science — mycorrhizal networks, nutrient cycling, compaction
- Hydrology — watershed management, riparian buffers, water quality

**Search terms:** silviculture, forest ecology, stand dynamics, forest regeneration, close-to-nature forestry, adaptive forest management

## 2. Forest Inventory & Monitoring
How to measure and track what's in the forest over time.

**Key subtopics:**
- Tree inventory — species, DBH (diameter at breast height), height, crown class
- Plot-based sampling — fixed-radius plots, variable-radius (prism) plots
- Remote sensing — LiDAR, satellite imagery, aerial photography
- Drone surveys — photogrammetry, multispectral imaging

- Certification — FSC, SFI, American Tree Farm System
- Regulations — state forestry laws, endangered species, wetland protections
- Estate planning — succession, gift tax, basis step-up
- Liability — recreational use statutes, timber theft, trespass

**Search terms:** forest ownership structure, conservation easement, timber tax, forest certification, forestland estate planning

## 6. Biodiversity & Wildlife
The living systems within the forest beyond the trees.

**Key subtopics:**
- Habitat management — snags, downed wood, den trees, nesting sites
- Riparian ecology — stream buffers, aquatic habitat, erosion control
